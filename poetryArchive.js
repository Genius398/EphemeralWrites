So many have died”,<br>And what will you do friend, watch and move aside?<br>For as long as we lived, governments have been sly<br>Yet the one thing they choose to for stats is outright lie.<br><br>Is war really needed, or started just for fun?<br>Do people really see everything under the sun?<br>For a show of power does it make an excuse?<br>And for the victims, does it make the noose?<br><br>Is war just a name, or something to frighten the weak?<br>Just for the joy of death, a reason do people seek?<br>Why do we do so, when it lacks a basic reason,<br>And when citizens object it, we define it as treason?<br><br>Palestine and Israel, is that all you care for?<br>Let’s say Ruso-Ukraine, why only the two war?<br>Putting one in war’s picture, that barely shows reality,<br>No matter the true victor, it ends as just a catastrophe.<br><br>“We gave them the money, what more can they need?”,<br>“Just remove their rations if their voice will exceed”.<br>Brother, they need the one who killed himself on a track,<br>Brother, all they want is the one who shot himself in the back.<br><br>Is this what war is, an endless show of force?<br>What is what war is, a comedy show or a history course?<br>Has war become this, a theatre watched by the rich?<br>Has war become so common that leaders say “which”?<br><br>Do soldiers know that they follow orders of barbarism?<br>Do people value themselves, or the selfish supporters of communism?<br>Do leaders know what happens to the ones who are innocent?<br>Do dictators know what is happening while they are vinolent?<br><br>Beneath the rubble's weight, where dreams once gleamed,<br>Lies truth so harsh, in shadows, it's redeemed.<br>In war's cruel grip, just half the horrors gleaned,<br>But heed this warning, are we truly keen?</div> <div style='text-align:right;'><br>By <i>Anantjit Chander</i><br>June 17 2023</div>",
